Section 2 Assignment
For this second assignment I really struggled with Syntax errors caused by spacing, tabs, etc. I know this comes with time.

While I did not use a scheduled tutor, this is how I solved the issues and completed my assignment:
- I did all the folder creation on GitLab first of all and got eveything organized as I had had issues with this on Assignment 1, that was the easiest part.
- I went back to previous class work in Solved & Unsolved folder and found similar activities. I also used my notes from those dates. 
I was able to use similar code and use hints from those in-class assignments to get started and completed about 60% of assignment by Thursday 2/29
- Thursday class I stayed for office hours to focus on "ask customer quantity of item" as this was not an example I had from past assignments. We covered the course. 
- Because I was going back and forth with split screen (I now realize was a mistake) to move all text and code to the left indentation so it would be easy to see as I was only working with one monitor. This caused many sintax errors.
- I worked through the syntax errors by using the "problems" tab in my command part of VS Code. I liked that it said what line and by going back to the original download of the menu I was able to get most of the issues resolved. 
- I also viewed the recordings of office hours for Monday the 4th and Tuesday the 5th. The main error I fixed here was that I typed "isAdigit" instead of "isdigit."
- The last issue I stayed after hours on Tuesday the 5th with the instructor and while we could not resolve it that day (it was hard to see) but I had a line that was 1 space off from where it should and was preventing the totals from adding at the last step. 
- I got that issue resolved on Wednesday the 6th to turn in the assignment.
